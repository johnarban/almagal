# Tour notes: where the numbers and example sources come from

Working notes for the ALMAGAL tour steps in `src/tour/`. Everything the tour
asserts beyond the scientists' own copy should be traceable from here.

`steps/TourStep1-4.vue` hold the scientists' four sections, verbatim and
nothing else; they should not be edited. Everything we wrote lives on the
matching `TourStep1b-4b.vue` slides, which pair each button with a line on what
it reveals.

## Exact quotes (ALMAGAL I, arXiv:2503.05555v1)

All quoted verbatim; section/figure attributions are as reported by the paper's
HTML version.

> The L/M for the two fields in Fig. 14 is ∼0.05 for AG028.5671-0.2329 and ∼26
> for AG288.9609+0.2643, respectively.

— Sect. 4.2.2. **Step 3 no longer uses this pair** (see "Step 3 sources"
below for what replaced it, and why); kept here since the L/M framing quoted
further down still backs the step's L/M filter buttons. AG028.5671-0.2329 is
the top panel in Fig. 14, AG288.9609+0.2643 the bottom.

Fig. 14 is a **morphology** comparison, not an evolutionary-stage one. The
quantity it reports is

> the ratio A_RoI/A_C-Hull between the area of the largest RoI and its convex
> hull area computed over the areas with signal above the 5σ level

— Sect. 4.2.2, defining Q5σhull. High means regular/compact, low means
irregular:

> Q5σhull ... drops to 0.5 for the more complex structure field (bottom)

— Sect. 4.2.2. The two properties are linked, which was the original reason
step 3 put a morphology pair and the L/M filters on the same page; the pair is
gone but the L/M buttons stayed:

> The relationship of this parameter with the clump's evolutionary stage in
> Fig. 16 shows a broadly decreasing trend with L/M, indicating that the emission
> morphology of the largest emission area in each field gets more and more
> complex as the field is more evolved.

— Sect. 4.2.2.

**Do not call AG028.5671-0.2329 "quiescent."** An earlier draft of step 3 did;
it is wrong. The distinction Fig. 14 draws is regular versus complex structure,
and the clump has cores in it either way.

> Two ALMAGAL fields showing different morphologies for similar 5σ emission
> areas. The blue contours in each field correspond to the 5σ noise level, while
> the yellow polygons represent the computed convex hull for the largest RoI in
> the fields. We have Q5σhull is ∼0.85 for the field in the top map, and ∼0.5 for
> the field in the bottom map. In both plots, the red ellipse in the bottom-right
> corner is the beam. Source AG name and running number as in Table 1.

— Fig. 14 caption.

> The values of clump L/M go from ∼0.05, which is typical of early-stage
> IRDC-like clumps, to ∼450, which is common to IR-bright clumps hosting actively
> forming protostellar objects often associated with HII regions

— Sect. 3.1. Backs the "L/M is the clock" framing in step 3.

> From the evolutionary viewpoint, both the L/M and the shape of the SED for
> λ≤70 μm have been used as a broad evolutionary classification of the clumps.

— Sect. 3.1.

> This confirms that the ALMAGAL sample spans the entire path from IRDC-hosted
> clump to the Hii region phase.

— Sect. 3.1.

> The following selection criteria were adopted: i) distance < 7.5 kpc from the
> Sun to be able to resolve the target 1000 au spatial scale with the selected
> configurations setup...ii) clump masses > 500 M⊙ in the inner and 250 M⊙ in the
> outer Galaxy; and iii) surface densities Σ≥0.1 g cm⁻² threshold that is
> critical for high-mass star formation

before quoting this one publicly).

> (a) Galactic distribution of ALMAGAL target clumps are shown on the left, with
> a symbol size of ∝Log(Mc) (clump mass) and color coded by Σc (surface density),
> as determined from the Hi-GAL data (non-beam-deconvolved), reflecting the

> in Table 1, available at the CDS. [...] b) Lbol/Mclump plot for the 1017

— Fig. 4 caption. Its example fields are all in our catalog, if we ever want
more of them: AG013.4582-0.0377 (#46), AG013.7869-0.2359 (#48),
AG024.5252-0.1390 (#186), AG028.3456+0.0605 (#263), AG284.0055-0.8459 (#400),
AG285.2633-0.0501 (#417), AG311.4675+0.3724 (#592), AG320.2463-0.2942 (#647).

### Unverified

A first pass at the Fig. 2 caption returned a phrase saying the HII-region
asterisks "occupy mostly the region above L/M=10". A second retrieval did not
reproduce it, so **treat it as unverified** — check the PDF before repeating it.
The tour does not rely on it; the L/M<1 and L/M>10 boundaries in the tour come
from the scientists' own text.

## Step 3 sources

Fig. 1 caption (Wallace et al. 2026, arXiv:2510.12892v3): "Three ALMAGAL
targets are selected as examples to depict typical morphology in the Isolated
(top), Simple (middle), and Rich (bottom) clump categories." Panel AG names
read off the figure itself, not off the HTML text (an earlier pass at this
that read the AG names out of an automated summary of the HTML got three
*different*, wrong identifiers -- always check figure labels against the
actual figure image, not a text extraction).

All three from our catalog (`src/assets/almagal_sources.json` +
`almagal_clump_props_WWT.json`), and our own TYPE column agrees with the
paper's category for every one of them:

| | AG335.5905+0.1853 | AG337.1764-0.0321 | AG316.7996-0.0559 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fig. 1 category | Isolated (top) | Simple (middle) | Rich (bottom) |
| internal id | 821718 | 830494 | 744714 |
| catalog TYPE | isolated | simple | rich |
| L/M (L⊙/M⊙) | 0.096 | 2.966 | 11.442 |
| mass (M⊙) | 479.2 | 1415.9 | 766.9 |
| dust temp (K) | 10.3 | 16.8 | 28.4 |

## Per-source FITS stretch

Measured off the archive images in
`~/data_storage/almagal/almagal_download_20260603202701/<iid>/<iid>_cont_7MTM2TM1_jointdeconv.image.pbcor.fits`
(all values Jy/beam; noise is the RMS of the negative pixels, which are
signal-free):

| | 821718 | 830494 | 744714 |
|---|---|---|---|
| peak | 1.55e-3 | 2.32e-2 | 1.81e-2 |
| rms | 1.44e-4 | 2.31e-4 | 4.68e-4 |
| peak/rms | 11 | 100 | 39 |
| p99.9 | 6.59e-4 | 7.80e-3 | 6.85e-3 |
| **tour vmin** | 1.5e-4 (1σ) | 2.0e-4 (~1σ) | 4.5e-4 (~1σ) |
| **tour vmax** | 1.2e-3 | 1.5e-2 | 1.2e-2 |

vmin at 1σ, vmax at roughly 2x p99.9 and clear of the peak, matching the
existing pair's convention. Unlike that pair, **these three were only checked
against the numbers above, not by eye** -- the earlier pair's vmin/vmax were
confirmed by rendering the FITS offline under the same log stretch WWT
applies; that visual pass has not been done for these three yet. Worth doing
before calling the cuts final.

## Other numbers used by the tour

- **Mass cuts on step 4** (`filterByMass`): clump mass in our catalog runs
  11.6–12424.8 M⊙, median 805.6, p25 585, p75 1305, p90 2163. The buttons use
  ≥2000 M⊙ ("high", 118 clumps) and ≤500 M⊙ ("low"), i.e. the tails rather than
  a split at the median.
- **Stage cuts on step 3** (`filterByStage`): L/M < 1 (429 clumps), 1–10 (318),
  > 10 (270). Thresholds are the scientists' own, from the step 4 text.
- **L/M = -999** marks a missing value in the catalog. The filters pass
  `null` for an open end, and `setFilterRange` substitutes the column's measured
  minimum (which excludes -999), so those rows stay filtered out.
- **Step 2 field**: RA 164.4655, Dec -59.4909 — the AG288.9609+0.2643 field in
  the Carina arm, chosen because both DECaPS DR1 (southern plane, visible) and
  the Herschel SPIRE HiPS (Hi-GAL, far-IR) cover it. GLIMPSE 360 proper covers
  65° < l < 265°, so it is *not* a safe "infrared" button at l = 289.
- **Orion** is ~400 pc away and the nearest high-mass star-forming region;
  framing for its three bands comes from `public/orion_m42_wide.wtml` itself.
